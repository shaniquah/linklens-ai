Continuous learning and adaptability.\n\nStart by identifying which aspects of your role can be enhanced (not replaced) by AI.

Be genuinely helpful to others\n2. Share knowledge freely\n3. Celebrate others' successes\n4. Stay in touch consistently\n5.

Lead with curiosity, not need\n2. Ask thoughtful questions about their work\n3. Share relevant insights or resources\n4. Follow up with value, not requests\n5. Maintain relationships during good times\n\nWhen you focus on giving first, receiving becomes natural.\n\nThe best networkers are the best givers.",

What can I learn from this?\n2. How can I improve next time?\n3. What opportunity might this create?\n\nYour greatest comeback is always ahead of you, not behind you."
